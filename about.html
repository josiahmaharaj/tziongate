          July 2017. 26 Children attended the Camp and provided below is a
          summary of the achievements:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Daily, the Camp started with Prayer and the Children were given a
              Scripture Verse from the Bible. The Children were taught the Ten
              Commandments and they sang the National Anthem, and recited the
              National Pledge, National Watch Words and National Motto.
            </li>
            <li>
              We took the Children on 3 Field Trips – (1) WASA Educational
              Centre in St. Joseph where they were taught about “Water
              Conservation” and toured the Facility to understand the various
              aspects of Water. (2) Airguard Services – At this facility, the
              children learned about the Services offered and they toured one of
              the Airplanes and a Helicopter. (3) Bonanza Horse Farm where the
              children toured the Horse Stables and rode the Horses.
            </li>
            <li>
              On the final day, we presented each Child with a 'Back to School'
              stationery package consisting of pens, pencils, ruler, eraser,
              sharpener copybooks, educational book, drawing book, coloured
              pencils. In addition to the basic stationery items, we gave a
              geometry set, a Bible and note books and a sketch pad to 7
              Children attending Secondary School. We also presented an ‘eco
              green bag’ to each child which was donated by the Ministry of
              Social Development and Family Services.
            </li>
            <li>
              Closing Ceremony - We invited Parents and Guardians to the Closing
              Ceremony on the final day of the Camp. The Children sang the
              National Anthem and recited the National Pledge, National Watch
              Words and National Motto. The Children danced to the “Electric
              Slide” and one Child did a solo Dance to “Still I Rise” by Yolanda
              Adams, and all the Children sang “Heal the World”. The program
              ended with the Parents presenting Certificates of Participation to
              the Children, followed by the Children presenting personalized
              ‘Thank You Cards’ to the Tzion Gate Volunteers.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          For the 2017 Easter School Vacation, we sponsored 5 pre-teens and
          teens from 3 Primary Schools and 2 Secondary Schools to attend a
          Self-Development Easter Camp hosted by A.P. Toussaint which covered
          topics such as Anger Management, Talent Development, Dining and Social
